# Cluster build — cross-item integration escalations (running list)

Contract questions and cross-item couplings surfaced by landed FC-P items. Any
agent implementing a **glue** item (P0.9, P1.3, P2.x, P3.8) or a coordinator/
barrier item MUST read this before wiring. Each entry: who raised it, what it
affects, and the current disposition.

## OPEN — awaiting a Fable ruling

### E1. Seam buffer semantics: frame-level vs 132-byte SYSAP body (raised by FC-P3.5)
`cnxman_ops.send/respond` in the frozen FC-P0.1 seam names its param `body` and
its doc says "Production: `scs_send_msg` on the CSB's CDT" — which implies a
132-byte SYSAP **body**. But the FC-P3.1 codec is **frame-level** throughout,
with `vms_cm_link` as its stand-in. FC-P3.5 emits complete **204-byte CM frames**
and added `cnxman_barrier_link_ops.next_out` so the CM still owns the
envelope/token.
- **Affects:** FC-P0.9 (port glue), FC-P1.3, FC-P2.2/P2.x (SCS), FC-P3.8 (the
  membership glue that wires barrier+coordinator+quorum together). They MUST all
  land on ONE reading.
- **If it becomes body-only:** the codec needs body-level builders and P3.5's
  three call sites change.
- **Disposition:** ESCALATED to Fable. Do not wire the glue until ruled.

## RESOLVED / carried couplings

### E2. `enum cnxman_event` has no op-0x0f cell (raised by FC-P3.5)
op-0x0f (the class-0x03 extra step, a real participant obligation) has no
enumerator in the frozen `enum cnxman_event`. FC-P3.5 routed it through a
documented one-opcode auxiliary echo OUTSIDE the `[state][event]` table.
- **Disposition:** FC-P3.12 (coordinator) decides — if it needs op-0f in the
  table, add an enumerator to `vms_cnxman.h` (additive) and update the barrier's
  aux path to match. Carried into the P3.12 dispatch.

### E3. `club->proposed_valid` sets the barrier's proposed→effective quorum copy (raised by FC-P3.5)
The barrier copies proposed→effective quorum cells ONLY if `club->proposed_valid`;
it never sets that flag (asserting quorum 0 would be a fabricated quorum).
- **Status:** FC-P3.7 landed `votes_valid` (per-CSB) but did NOT set
  `proposed_valid` (CLUB-level). So the barrier's effective-quorum copy currently
  never fires. This is acceptable while quorum is tracking-only, but **FC-P3.8
  (or whichever item first drives a real commit) MUST set `proposed_valid` when it
  fills the proposed cells**, or effective quorum stays stale. Not blocking today.

### E4. Codec objects are wired into the kernel module lists by their first FSM consumer
FC-P0.8 wired `vms_cluster_codec.o`/`_hello.o` and FC-P3.5 wired `_cm.o` into
`src/kernel/Makefile`, the distro Kbuild, `src/kernel-netbsd/Makefile`, and the
two `tools/cross-vax/build-*-vax.sh` SRCS — because their FSMs cannot link
without them. A codec TU with **no in-module consumer yet** (e.g. FC-P6.2's
`vms_cluster_codec_mscp`) is wired into the host `tests/cluster/host/CMakeLists.txt`
ONLY, and is added to the kernel lists by the first item that consumes it
in-module (e.g. FC-P3.4/P6.3). **Do not re-add a codec object already present**
(dedup on merge — the integrator has hit this on every FSM merge).

### E5. FC-P0.9 must not re-add the codec objects (raised by FC-P0.8)
FC-P0.7's CMake comment deferred codec module-wiring to P0.9, but P0.8 already
did it (its FSM couldn't link otherwise). P0.9 must NOT re-add
`vms_cluster_codec.o`/`_hello.o` to any build list.
